Problem in flow-->when pagination appear in customers/list then i cant pop up form and search..but i can search and pop up form in customers/?page=1





->Product is already available or added first
-->Then you add the customers
-->Now you order.Product and Customer are foreign key in Table(Model) because Particular Product is
    order is Customer.So,attribute of Product and Customer should be available in Order Model
-->

Filter search
-------------
-->navbar search field include in every apps


-------------------------------------------------------------
When customer order ---input field 
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) Product name 
2)status pending 
3)quantity--->reduce quantity when i order the product
4)price per quantity
------>But its total price will be shown automatially when you click(view) to see the particular details of customers
